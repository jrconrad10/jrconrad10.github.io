# Projects

[Animation](https://github.com/jrconrad10/GettingAnimated.git)

This project uses java and animates a square to move around a panel bouncing off the panel walls and change the color of the square.

[Maze Solver](https://github.com/jrconrad10/MazeSolver.git)

This project uses java and takes a user input of a maze file and then takes a user input of a start and end location for their maze. The program then solves the maze and creates a file with the solution.

[Airplanes](https://github.com/jrconrad10/Airplanes.git)

This project uses java swing to create a GUI for airplanes to fly on a screen. Three radio buttons are created, one for doing nothing, one for random movement, and one for following the leader. There is one green leader airplane and three red follower airplanes. Pressing a radio button sets a movement pattern that can then be invoked on a plane by clicking it.

# Group Project

[GPA Calculator](https://github.com/sahalk903/GPAQU.git)

This is a group project using java where my partners and I created a weighted gpa calculator which stores the grades in a file for the user to look at whenever they would like.
