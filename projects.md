This project uses java and animates a square to move around a panel bouncing off the panel walls and change the color of the square.

[Maze Solver](https://github.com/jrconrad10/MazeSolver.git)

This project uses java and takes a user input of a maze file and then takes a user input of a start and end location for their maze. The program then solves the maze and creates a file with the solution.
