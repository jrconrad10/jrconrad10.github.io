# About Me

Hello my name is Jacob Conrad! I am a freshman computer science major at Quinnipiac University and I am from Connecticut. I like animals, although I just have one dog for now, a cockapoo, I hope to get more later. I love playing sports like football, baseball, and basketball, but I do also love my current major. In high school I took three different programming classes and I really enjoyed them and the problem solving aspect. I have worked a few manual labor jobs and a customer service jobs and that just isn't for me. This lead me to want to use my brain as a tool for problem solving rather than exhausting my body everyday with some other job. Quinnipiac is a very good computer science school and this ultimately lead me to attend in the fall of 2020. I can't wait to grow and do big things in the programming field!
